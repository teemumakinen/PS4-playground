# PS4-playground
A collection of PS4 tools and experiments using the WebKit exploit. This is for firmware 1.76 only at the moment.  Although initially just a framework to help write and execute ROP chains, the playground now allows for running unsigned binaries compiled with the PS4-SDK, and booting Linux from USB.
